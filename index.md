# Intro:
I am Omkar, a software engineer and tech leader; with a unique career path & self learning habits and I have a Happy career stage right now. 
In last 5 years, I have been told by many of my students that I was able to provide good perspective and guidance to them for the industry. 
I have interviewed many aspiring developers for tech roles and nurtured over 30+ engineers to senior SDE levels. 
I have spoken with many students, noticed them being misguided and lost in their early stages of professional careers. Hence, this community.

I say, Let's try to provide some **clarity, structure and guidance** to their future. 

Feel free to join and ask me anything :)
