India's technical education infrastructure includes 2500 engineering colleges, 1400 polytechnics and 200 schools of architecture.
Annually: 
Approximately 10,00,000 Students graduate with Engineering Degrees:

Assuming 50,000 do very well (excluding them), 

we are left with around 9 Lakh Graduates of which I believe
- 50k to 70k are well trained, well determined and have good potential but with bad opportunities.
- 200k to 300k are not well trained but well determined Engineers.
- rest 6Lakh graduates are... well, I am not sure what is happening to this huge number of people.

On the other side, we know that the nation is capable of creating employment for all of these students. 

How ? 
let's see.
